# Simple CNN
### Overview
This is a simple convolution nural network model designed to identify text. This was part of a computer architecture class called CPEG323 at the Unisersity
of Delaware as an intoduction to ARMv8 assembly. A majority of the work I contributed to this project is in the assembly files and slight tweaks 
to some of the python simulation files.
